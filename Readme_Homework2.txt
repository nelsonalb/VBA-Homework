This VBA macro was created to analyze a set of stock market data across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. Here is a brief explanation of what the macro does:

The macro loops through each worksheet in the workbook, activating each worksheet in turn.
The macro determines the range of data in column A for the current worksheet, and saves this range as a string variable.
The macro reads in the data in the determined range, saving the unique stock ticker symbols to an array.
For each unique stock ticker symbol, the macro loops through the rows in the worksheet, identifying the first and last dates associated with the ticker symbol, and calculating the open and close values and total volume associated with the ticker symbol.
The macro calculates the yearly change and percent change in value for each ticker symbol.
The macro determines the ticker symbol with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume, saving the corresponding values and ticker symbols to cells in the worksheet.
The macro colors cells in column L based on whether the percent change for each ticker symbol is positive, negative, or zero.
